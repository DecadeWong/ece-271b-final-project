We select the Kaggle Competition--TensorFlow Speech-Recognition Challenge as our course project for ECE 271b - statistical learning.

We use CNN instead of tradional approach RNN to solve this sequence processing problem. And we introduce GLU-gated linear units to the original model and improve the performance, the best accuracy we achieve is around 95.6%. Due to the computing resource limits, we can't run our test on the entire dataset, so it's a little bit unfair to compare our results with others.
